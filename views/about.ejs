            The Swansea University Race Engineering Team is a diverse group of 
            driven students who work together throughout the year to build a Formula style car.
            From the first design to the manufacturing and procurement of parts, students prepare to present their 
            car to a panel of judges at the Silverstone during the Formula Student Competition.

          <p class="car-box-right-text">We are Swansea University Race Engineering, a student-led motorsport team driven by
             a passion for innovation and engineering excellence. Competing in the prestigious Formula Student competition,
              our team brings together students from diverse disciplines to design, build, and race a high-performance car. 
              Through teamwork, creativity, and dedication, we aim to build our skills and knowledge, representing Swansea 
              University on an international stage.

          <p class="car-box-left-text">Our team designs, builds, and races a Formula Student car from the ground up,
             focusing on every aspect of engineering from aerodynamics and powertrain to suspension and electronics. 
             We tackle the full lifecycle of development, from initial concept and design through to testing and competition. 
             Alongside building a high-performance car, we develop practical skills in project management, teamwork,
              and problem-solving, preparing us for real-world engineering challenges

          <p class="car-box-right-text">The Swansea University Race Engineering Team has diligently worked
            over the past five years to restore its pre-pandemic strength and competitiveness. As one of only three 
            Welsh teams in the Formula Student competition, our previous absence from the track without a functioning 
            car has only fueled our determination to excel. After successfully entering the Concept Class last year, 
            we gained invaluable insights into design, engineering, and project management. We are now excited to 
            implement those lessons as we transition to the Formula Student class with a fully built car this season.
