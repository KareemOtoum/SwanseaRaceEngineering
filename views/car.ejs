             to ensure compliance with Formula Student regulations. Our focus this year includes implementing
              flatshifting, traction control, and launch control systems, powered by a newly configured ECU. 
              Additionally, we are introducing a drive-by-wire system, which replaces traditional mechanical 
              linkages with electronic controls, allowing for more precise throttle management and enhancing 
              both performance and responsiveness on the track. These advancements ensure our car is equipped 
              with the latest in control technology to gain a competitive edge.

            current suspension system to enhance stability and responsiveness for the driver. 
            This includes designing and manufacturing new wishbones, a steering column, and tie rods, 
            alongside the integration of shock absorbers and front and rear pushrods. We are also 
            exploring a direct actuation approach, which would simplify the suspension layout and 
            improve response by connecting the dampers directly to the wheels. By refining each 
            component, we aim to achieve precise handling and optimal balance, ensuring our car 
            performs reliably under all track conditions.

            developing, and optimising the aerodynamic components of our Formula Student car to maximize
             performance. Our efforts are directed at improving downforce, reducing drag, and enhancing 
             overall vehicle efficiency. This includes the creation of front and rear wings, diffusers, 
             and other critical aerodynamic elements, leveraging advanced CAD and CFD analysis tools to 
             ensure precision and effectiveness. By meticulously refining these components, we aim to
